# Background

The 21st century has changed Wall St. Trading and finance is no longer based on intuition and company fundamentals, but has developed into the world of algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. The "new" business has
# Mission
QuantCademy is dedicated to training high school quants and not only preparing them for the world of algo trading, but quickly introducing them to it. We have a "head first" mindset, in that we believe that for students to succeed in the high pace of Wall St. at such a young age, they must get their hands dirty with everything that a real quant does. Our curriculum is thus designed to push students abilities and knowledge as close as it can get to that of a professional. The academy is thus highly engaging and interactive, and it relies on students' self-motivation to succeed. By March, students have the ability to research their own trading strategies and use their knowledge and portfolio of work to build their own network of industry contacts. The end result in June is a real-world ready quant, perhaps spending their summer interning in a financial engineering lab or at a trader's desk.
# Curriculum
Quantitative finance is really an multi-disciplinary field: It is the overlap of advanced mathematics, statistics, computer science, and finance. The education students receive thus engages all of these disciplines, and due to time constraints, it is expected that students continue working and learning about topics at home using provided online resources. While this is not necessary, they will otherwise not be able to reap the full benefits of the academy, and will have much greater struggles when the academy begins doing individual research. 

## Prerequisites
Before students can become quants, they must have a solid foundation in all these fields. It is for this reason that __the club is only recommended for students who have completed Math Analysis I__, because this course provides students with basic mathematical and analytical skills that are essentials for quantitative trading. 

From Day 1, students are instructed in computer programming in Python. It is recommended that students spend as much time as possible at home programming and even do their best to apply it to schoolwork in STEM subjects. While we do offer guidance and instruction upon any request, the Codecademy and Datacamp websites are emphasized as a resource.

The academy's prerequisite sessions conclude with an introduction to frequency statistics. It is hoped that during the 2 weeks that the topic is discussed, students begin to develop a mindset for statistics. They will at the very least have the prequisities to continue forward.
