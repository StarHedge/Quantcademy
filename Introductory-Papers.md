# Background & the Need for QuantCademy
The 21st century has changed Wall St. Trading and finance is no longer based on intuition and company fundamentals, but has developed into the world of algorithmic trading and quantitative finance. The "new" business has

# Mission
QuantCademy is dedicated to training high school quants and not only preparing them for the world of algo trading, but quickly introducing them to it. We have a "head first" mindset, in that we believe that for students to succeed in the high pace of Wall St. at such a young age, they must get their hands dirty with everything that a real quant does. Our curriculum is thus designed to push students abilities and knowledge as close as it can get to that of a professional. The Academy is thus highly engaging and interactive, and relies on students' self-motivation to succeed. By March, students have the ability to research their own trading strategies and use their knowledge and portfolio of work to build their own network of industry contacts. The end result in June is a real-world ready quant, perhaps spending their summer interning in a financial engineering lab or at a trader's desk.

# Curriculum
Quantitative finance is really an multi-disciplinary field: It is the overlap of advanced mathematics, statistics, computer science, and finance. The education students receive thus engages all of these disciplines, and due to time constraints, it is expected that students continue working and learning about topics at home using provided online resources. While this is not necessary, they will otherwise not be able to reap the full benefits of the academy, and will have much greater struggles when the academy begins individual research. 

Furthermore, the skills and techniques in later parts learned in later parts of the year build off of those learned at the beginning. The curriculum is also designed in a way that students 

## Prerequisites
Before students can become quants, they must have a solid foundation in all these fields. It is for this reason that __the club is only recommended for students who have completed Math Analysis I__, because the course provides students with basic mathematical and analytical skills that are essentials for quantitative trading. Unfortunately, without them students will not be able to master even the Academy's prerequisites lessons.

From Day 1, students are instructed in computer programming in Python. It is recommended that students spend as much time as possible at home programming and even do their best to apply it to schoolwork in STEM subjects. While we do offer guidance and instruction upon any request, the Codecademy and Datacamp websites are emphasized as a resource.

Another essential to all statistical learning is knowledge of calculus concepts. While it may be brief, at the very least basic understanding is absolutely necessary. Students will be introduced to derivatives, integrals, and partial derivatives.

The Academy's prerequisite sessions conclude with an introduction to frequency statistics. It is hoped that during the 2 weeks that the topic is discussed, students begin to develop a mindset for statistics. They will at the very least have the prequisities to continue forward.

*Approximate time of section: 3 weeks—1.5 months*

## Regression & Optimization
Regression is an incredibly common, but critical asset that all quants have in their toolbox. It is also a critical lesson for future students of time series analysis and machine learning because its various methodologies and applications provide beginners with a great foundation in several fundamental principles and techniques. At this stage, there will be much emphasis on students implementing the techniques in Python. There will be an emphasis on numerical optimization, with a thorough discussion of gradient descent and mini-batch (stochastic) learning. This will be the principle method applied to regression, though students will be introduced to other methods.

*Approximate time of section: 1 month*

## Introduction to Univariate Time Series Analysis and Statistical Arbitrage
A time series is defined as a dataset composed of elements that are observed consecutively in time. Many quantitative trading strategies are based in forecasts of financial time series (e.g. price series of the Dow Jones). Moreover, the ability to skillfully analyze and perhaps forecast even a single-variable time series may very well be the centerpiece of their first trading strategy. Even if it is not, it will necessarily broaden students perspectives on and will be a prerequisite to any work done using machine learning. Students are thus presented with many developed models for analysis. In all cases and  All  In chronological order, topics to be covered include:
- The "mean model"
- Stationarity, transformations, and autocorrelation
- The random walk
- Cointegration/Pairs trading
- Autoregressive processes
- ARMA/ARIMA processes
- ARCH/GARCH processes
- Introduction to Fourier analysis

Students will be encouraged to apply the techniques learned by practicing analysis of real financial data. At this stage, it is hoped that students have begun to acquire the mindset and intuition of a real quant. At the end of the section, students will be given the option to continue with machine learning or begin their own research project/trading strategy with the guidance of the Academy. Possible topics for research include volatility clustering/modeling, applications of financial time series analysis, etc.
