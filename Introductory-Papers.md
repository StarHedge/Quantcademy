# Quantcademy: The Introductory Papers — March 29, 2017
## Background & the Need for Quantcademy

The foundation of success in modern finance lies in the capability to create mathematically thoughtful and technologically innovative automated trading strategies. To do so requires a significant depth of knowledge in technical subjects including math and statistics, resulting in the majority of Wall St. recruits now being math and physics majors. Unfortunately, most undergraduate finance and economic majors are ill-prepared for what awaits them at the trading desk, and even more so with high-schoolers.

I have long had a dream to be a trader. Since I entered Bergen Tech, I realized that to compete on Wall St., I need to do better than reading charts. I need to be a quant. I have thus spent an enormous quantity of time trying to acquire the academic savvy to create algorithmic trading strategies. Fortunately, my efforts have paid off and I am currently involved in researching and writing my own strategy. 

Most other teens that want to trade either (a) do not realize what it takes or (b) do not how to acquire the necessary skills. While there are exceptions and there are some qualitative traders (albeit becoming ever more rare), it is unlikely that they will ever be able to achieve their dream. I am starting QuantCademy on a mission to help them.

## Mission

Quantcademy is dedicated to training high school quants and not only preparing them for the world of algo trading, but quickly introducing them to it through assistance in research and networking. We have a "head first" mindset: For students to succeed in the high pace workplace of Wall St. at such a young age, they must get their hands dirty with everything that a real quant does. Our curriculum is thus designed to push students abilities and knowledge as close as it can get to that of a professional. 

The Academy's program is indeed ambitious, and relies on students' self-motivation to succeed. However, it is also interactive, and the structure of our sessions are quite adverse from regular classes in a way that (a) mimics the cohesive culture at quantitative trading firms and (b) keeps students engaged.

By April, students have the ability to begin researching their own trading strategies and use their knowledge and portfolio of work to build their own network of industry contacts. The end result is a quant with the academic training necessary to break into the industry.

## Talks from Industry Professionals

We guarantee that once per month, the Academy will invite a quantitative finance professional to speak to our students, either in person or via digital communication. Some weeks this may mean a Q&A with a quant trader or analyst, while other weeks may be a talk from a professor of financial engineering. The visitations have several key benefits that makes them central to the Academy's function:
- Hear feedback from professionals on their ideas and studies
- Get a first-hand perspective on the field and receive career advice
- Begin to establish a network of industry contacts

We will also attempt trips when possible to financial technology (FinTech) and/or machine learning workshops, hackathons, and conferences. Given board approval, we will also contact Quantopian, a quant education company, regarding any assistance they may be able to provide in terms of resources or even giving a workshop at our school. 

Additionally, by the 3rd year of the academy, the Academy expects to even host its own FinTech hackathon at Bergen Tech. We will acquire sponsors and make preparations accordingly, and it will provide students with an unforgettable leadership, networking, and industry experience.

## Curriculum
Quantitative finance is really an multi-disciplinary field: It is the overlap of advanced mathematics, statistics, computer science, and finance. The education students receive thus engages all of these disciplines, and due to time constraints, it is expected that students continue working and learning about topics at home using provided online resources. While this is not necessary, they will otherwise not be able to reap the full benefits of the academy, and will have much greater struggles when the academy begins individual research. Furthermore, the skills and techniques in later parts learned in later parts of the year build off of those learned at the beginning. The curriculum is also designed in a way that students 

### Prerequisites
Before students can become quants, they must have a solid foundation in all these fields. It is for this reason that __the club is only recommended for students who have completed Math Analysis I__, because the course provides students with basic mathematical and analytical skills that are essentials for quantitative trading. Unfortunately, without them students will not be able to master even the Academy's prerequisites lessons.

From Day 1, students are instructed in computer programming in Python. It is recommended that students spend as much time as possible at home programming and even do their best to apply it to schoolwork in STEM subjects. While we do offer guidance and instruction upon any request, the Codecademy and Datacamp websites are emphasized as a resource.

Another essential to all statistical learning is knowledge of calculus concepts. At the very least, a basic understanding is absolutely necessary. Students will be introduced to derivatives, integrals, and partial derivatives.

The Academy's prerequisite sessions conclude with an introduction to frequency statistics. It is hoped that during the 2 weeks that the topic is discussed, students begin to develop a mindset for statistics. They will at the very least have the prequisities to continue forward.

*Approximate time of section: 3 weeks—1.5 months*

### Regression & Optimization
Regression is an incredibly common, but critical asset that all quants have in their toolbox. It is also a critical lesson for future students of time series analysis and machine learning because its various methodologies and applications provide beginners with a great foundation in several fundamental principles and techniques. At this stage, there will be much emphasis on students implementing the techniques in Python. There will be an emphasis on numerical optimization, with a thorough discussion of gradient descent and mini-batch (stochastic) learning. This will be the principle method applied to regression, though students will be introduced to other methods.

*Approximate time of section: 1 month*

### Introduction to Univariate Time Series Analysis and Statistical Arbitrage
A time series is defined as a dataset composed of elements that are observed consecutively in time. Many quantitative trading strategies are based in forecasts of financial time series (e.g. price series of the Dow Jones). Moreover, the ability to skillfully analyze and perhaps forecast even a single-variable time series may very well be the centerpiece of their first trading strategy. Even if it is not, it will necessarily broaden students perspectives on and will be a prerequisite to any work done using machine learning. Students are thus presented with many developed models for analysis. In chronological order, topics to be covered include:
- The "mean model"
- Stationarity, transformations, and autocorrelation
- The random walk
- Cointegration/Pairs trading
- Autoregressive models
- ARMA/ARIMA processes
- ARCH/GARCH processes
- Introduction to Fourier analysis

Students will be encouraged to apply the techniques learned by practicing analysis of real financial data. At this stage, it is hoped that students have begun to acquire the mindset and intuition of a real quant. At the end of the section, students will be given the option to continue with machine learning or begin their own research project/trading strategy with the guidance of the Academy. Possible topics for research include volatility clustering/modeling, applications of financial time series analysis, etc.

*Approximate time of section: 2 months*

### Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning
Machine learning, often described as a discipline of artificial intelligence, is the programming of computers to observe and recognize significant patterns in data given a framework for the "learning" process. It is an extremely powerful data analysis tool that is the central component of many quantitative trading strategies. Supervised machine learning refers to learning with more specific outcomes in mind, and is generally simpler mathematically than unsupervised learning. With the exception of the research phase, this will be the most rigorous section of the program. In this section, we will do our best to emphasize mathematical understanding and academic rigor despite our time constraints. It will be absolutely critical for students to continue their education and work at home. The following is a sample for topics to be covered:
- K-nearest neighbors classification
- Bayesian Probability and Naive Bayes
- Logistic/kernel regression
- Support vector machines
- Decision trees & Random forests
- Feedforward neural networks
- Recurrent neural networks
- Learning with boosting

There will be a particular emphasis on the final topic of artifical neural networks, primarily due to its increasing prominence in algo trading. 

*Approximate time of section: 2.5 months*

### Final Phase: Independent Research
Students must now apply their knowledge. Over the past several months, they should have began to develop the mindset o
